#### Describe the issue you found
I have found 2 issues with the BITS'21 official website.

1. Task C06 : Description is "Create a Artificial Intelligence model to identify a water bottle"
                                                        

2. Task D11 : Description is "create assets For 3D game"


#### How it should be corrected

1. Task C06 : Should be "an Artifial" ( Because 'Artificial' have a vowel sound)

2. Task D11 : Should be "Create assets for a 3D game" Because the first word of a sentence must be started with a capital letter and a middle word "For" should be written in simple letters, Also it is better to display "3D game" as "a 3D game"

#### Additional Context

I tried to contribute for the BITS'21 official website from correcting those spelling and grammetical mistakes. But there can be some issues with my edits that I couldn't notice because this is my first contribution to an open source website. I should be really thankful for ACICTS for giving this chance for me !

Thank you,
